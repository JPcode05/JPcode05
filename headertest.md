# Duplicate Header Test
The goal is to see how a URL would change if a header was the same twice or more.

## This is a header
It is used once.

## This is a header
It is used twice.

## This is a header
Get ready for a curveball!

### This is a header
This is the curveball!

## The End
So what do you think? This was tested on GitHub.
