# Duplicate Header Test
The goal is to see how a URL would change if a header was the same twice or more.

## This is a header
It is used once.

## This is a header
It is used twice.

## This is a header
Get ready for a curveball!

[Why don't we link to a header?](#this is a header)

### This is a header
This is the curveball!

[What if I link to a header that doesn't exist?](#this-is-a-header-666)

## The End
So what do you think? This was tested on GitHub.
