- 👋 Hi, I’m @JPcode05
- 👀 I’m interested in computers and software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: nothing
- 📫 How to reach me: NO WAY!

Look at these commands:
git branch -m main <BRANCH>
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/<BRANCH> <BRANCH>
git remote set-head origin -a

If you want to rename "main", change it's name to <BRANCH>.
